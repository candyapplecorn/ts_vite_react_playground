# About

I wanted a little project that I could quickly jump into for times when I want to code something up.

This project uses React so that I can render stuff to a screen.

There's also a folder full of pure functions which only run in their corresponding unit tests.

This way, I can code up quick HTML things, as well as quick algorithms.

# TODO

1. __HOST ON GITHUB PAGES__ w/ GITHUB ACTIONS: I've set this up before on another project. Just gotta configure some YAML file and configure the github project to build and deploy on each code push. Once I get that done, making changes to my own public website will be as simple as committing and pushing code. How cool
2. __REAL PAGE ROUTING__: I was having fun just wasting time on the keyboard implementing some sort of page navigation system using contexts. Well, that's reinventing the wheel. If I were a smart mouse, I would just use a routing library like react router or react router dom or whatever the latest thing is.
3. __MAKE AN ACTUAL HOME PAGE__
4. __MAKE AN ACTUAL NAV BAR__
